codetest
========

You can use make to run the unit tests, the acceptance test and install a binary. I recommend doing this inside of a sandbox. And you will also need a custom version of the HUnit-Diff package. You can get it at: git@github.com:mattraibert/HUnit-Diff.git

If you're lucky, the included Makefile will successfully take care of all this for you:

```
cd /path/to/codetest
make
```
